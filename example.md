# Target function and approximation model
Here we show a new toy example that we consider a more complicated evaluation-truth relationship that the ground truth function is:
$$f(x) = -(x^2 - 1)\cos(3\pi x), x \in [-1, 1];$$
the two approximation models are deterministic:
$$f^1(x) = f(x) + 0.5(x + 1) \sin(32\pi x), x \in [-1, 1];$$
$$f^2(x) = f(x) - 0.5(x - 1) \sin(32\pi x), x \in [-1, 1];$$
